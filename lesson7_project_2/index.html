    <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <strong><em>Why go Dairy Free?</em></strong>
        <p>Whether you are sensitive to dairy, begining a challenge, or have a growing desire to venture into something new, there are many benefits that come with removing/limiting dairy consumption. These include, clearer skin, weightloss, decreasing your enviormental footprint, and better digestion. In fact, it has been estimated around "70% of the world's population has some degree of lactose intolerance". This is due to the fact that after weaning, humans no longer need the ability to digest milk so they begin producing less lactase which is used to break down and digest lactose. A dairy-free diet may actually aid digestion.</p>

         <strong><em>Dairy-Free meals</em></strong>
         <p>"What in the world am I going to eat?" is what you may be asking yourself. The answer is plenty!! You can still enjoy your favorite foods such as pizza, tacos, and sandwiches. For many recipes you can simply substitute the dairy ingredient required with a dairy alternative. For example instead of making mac and cheese with a cheddar, you can use vegan cheddar. Proteins such as chicken are also dairy-free so you can make lemon-pepper chicken with rice for dinner and not have to worry one bit. There are also thousands of recipes online that are dairy-free and take you step by step on how to prepare each dish.</p>
       
       
         <strong><em>Dairy-Free snacks and desserts</em></strong>
         <p>When it comes to snacks and desserts, the possibilities are endless. Pretzels, veggie chips, cereal, and fruits/vegetables are all dairy-free! Your favorite protein shakes and smoothies can also be made with the milk alternative of choice. Dairy-free ice cream has also become popular, several flavors made with almond milk and coconut milk have come to light in the past few years. Most dark chocolate is also dairy-free.</p>

    <strong><em>The Process</em></strong>
    
    &nbsp;
    
        <p>In recent years, quite the number of fad diets have grown increasingly popular. Whether it's keto or Atkins or going completly carbless, most have high failing rates. This happens because they are simply not maintanable over long periods of time. Many go into these diets with the sole purpose of losing weight. If you've ate carbs your entire life and all of a sudden you go cold turkey it isn't going to be easy and you'll likely go back to eating carbs. The same goes for removing dairy. Although going cold-turkey is an option, tweaking your diet and pacing yourself is a better one. Unless you are lactose-intolerant, all dairy shouldn't be completely removed. Just recuding your intake goes a long way. In the process your skin may even get clearer, a growing number of dermatologists are actually now reccomending removal of dairy as a possible remedy to acne. Weightloss may also take place since most junk foods contain high levels of dairy.</p>
