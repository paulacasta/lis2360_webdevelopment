    <strong><em>The Process</em></strong>
    
    &nbsp;
    
        <p>In recent years, quite the number of fad diets have grown increasingly popular. Whether it's keto or Atkins or going completly carbless, most have high failing rates. This happens because they are simply not maintanable over long periods of time. Many go into these diets with the sole purpose of losing weight. If you've ate carbs your entire life and all of a sudden you go cold turkey it isn't going to be easy and you'll likely go back to eating carbs. The same goes for removing dairy. Although going cold-turkey is an option, tweaking your diet and pacing yourself is a better one. Unless you are lactose-intolerant, all dairy shouldn't be completely removed. Just recuding your intake goes a long way. In the process your skin may even get clearer, a growing number of dermatologists are actually now reccomending removal of dairy as a possible remedy to acne. Weightloss may also take place since most junk foods contain high levels of dairy.</p>
